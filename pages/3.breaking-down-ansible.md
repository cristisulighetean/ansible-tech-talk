# Section II: Breaking down an Ansible project

Let's go back and take a closer look at the ansible playbook we presented earlier

## The Ansible Playbook

```yaml
---
- name: Deploy static website using Ansible
  hosts: webserver
  become: true
  tasks:

    - name: Update APT cache
      apt:
        update_cache: yes
        cache_valid_time: 3600

    - name: Install Nginx
      apt:
        name: nginx
        state: present

    - name: Ensure Nginx is running
      service:
        name: nginx
        state: started

    - name: Remove default Nginx site
      file:
        path: /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default
        state: absent
      notify: Restart Nginx

    - name: Deploy website from Git
      git:
        repo: 'https://YOUR_GIT_REPO_URL.git'
        dest: /var/www/mywebsite
        version: main

    - name: Configure Nginx to serve the site
      copy:
        dest: /etc/nginx/sites-available/mywebsite
        content: |
          server {
            listen 80;
            server_name mywebsite.com;
            root /var/www/mywebsite;
            index index.html;
          }

    - name: Enable the Nginx site configuration
      file:
        src: /etc/nginx/sites-available/mywebsite
        dest: /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
        state: link
      notify: Restart Nginx

  handlers:
    - name: Restart Nginx
      service:
        name: nginx
        state: restarted
```

## Inventory

The Inventory is Ansible's directory of hosts

- `Purpose:` It's where Ansible looks to determine the machines it should manage.
- `Flexibility:` You can define groups, group variables, and even group hosts in hierarchical fashion.
- `Static vs. Dynamic:` While you can have a static inventory (a simple file), there are dynamic inventory plugins for cloud providers or other platforms.

```yaml
# Individual hosts are listed here
host1.ansible.com
host2.ansible.com ansible_ssh_port=2222

# Here's a group of hosts
[web_servers]
web1.ansible.com
web2.ansible.com

[db_servers]
db1.ansible.com

# You can also set specific variables for a host in the inventory
[mail_servers]
mail.ansible.com ansible_ssh_user=mail_admin

# Group children and group vars
[parent_group]
child_group1
child_group2

[child_group1]
child1.ansible.com

[child_group2]
child2.ansible.com

[parent_group:vars]
some_variable=value
```
