# Section IV: Using Ansible Modules and Documentation

Ansible's power is unlocked when we understand its modules and know where to find the right information.

## Ansible Collections & Modules

Collections are a distribution format for Ansible content:

- `Why Collections?`
  - They allow you to bundle and distribute `playbooks`, `roles`, `modules`, and `even plugins` in a cohesive package.
- `Community and Partners:`
  - Collections can be developed and shared by anyone. [Ansible Galaxy](https://galaxy.ansible.com/) is a popular place where the community shares collections.
  
`Demonstration:` Let's dive into an example. Imagine we want to install docker & manage on multiple servers. We'll explore Ansible Galaxy to find a collection that helps us and then demonstrate its use in a playbook.

Let's search for an ansible role: [Ansible Galaxy}](https://galaxy.ansible.com/)

## Exploring Documentation

Ansible has extensive documentation, which is a treasure trove:

- `Module Docs:` Almost every module in Ansible comes with its own documentation.
  - This will often provide a `brief description`, `required parameters`, `examples`, and `return values`.
- `How to Access:` You can access module documentation directly from the command line using `ansible-doc <module_name>` or visit Ansible's official online documentation.
  
`TIP`: Always ensure you're looking at the documentation for the version of Ansible you're using, as modules and their parameters can change.
