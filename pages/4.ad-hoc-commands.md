# Section III: Running Ad-Hoc Commands with Ansible

Sometimes, you don't need a full playbook. You just need to quickly execute a command on your servers. Ansible offers a convenient way to do this.

## What is an Ad-Hoc Command?

Ad-Hoc commands allow you to use Ansible's capabilities without writing an entire playbook. It's like a `one-time action` you want to execute on your hosts.

## Why Use Ad-Hoc Commands?

1. `Quick Checks:` For example, to check if a service is running on all servers.
2. `Single Actions:` Maybe you just want to create a directory or restart a service.
3. `Initial Setup or Diagnosis:` Before you automate, sometimes you need to inspect or do preliminary configurations.

## How to Use Ad-Hoc Commands

You use the `ansible` command followed by the group of hosts (from your inventory), the `-m` option to specify a module, and the `-a` option to provide arguments to the module.

## Example 1: Ping all servers

```bash
ansible all -m ping
```

## Example 2: Get uptime of all servers

```bash
ansible all -m command -a "uptime"
```

## Example 3: Restart a service

```bash
ansible web -m service -a "name=httpd state=restarted"
```

`Note`: It's recommended for short-lived operations. For repeated tasks or complex operations, crafting a playbook is more efficient and maintainable.
