# Resources

## Further Learning

It's often said, the best way to learn is to immerse oneself in a subject. Here are some resources to deepen your understanding of Ansible:

- `Ansible Official Documentation:` [Ansible Docs](https://docs.ansible.com/)
  - A comprehensive guide to all things Ansible.
- `Ansible for DevOps Book:`
  - A deep dive into Ansible for those inclined towards reading. You can find it [here on LeanPub](https://leanpub.com/ansible-for-devops).
- `Ansible 101 Youtube Playlist:`
  - For the visual learners amongst us, Jeff Geerling's video series is an excellent starting point. Catch it [here on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goclfp6a2IQ&list=PL2_OBreMn7FqZkvMYt6ATmgC0KAGGJNAN).
- `Ansible Community:` Engage with the Ansible community through [Ansible Galaxy](https://galaxy.ansible.com/), forums, and local meetups.
