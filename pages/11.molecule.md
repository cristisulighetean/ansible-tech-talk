# Section VII: Molecule for Testing

Ensuring the reliability of our Ansible roles is crucial, and that's where Molecule comes in.

## What is Molecule?

Molecule provides a framework for developing and testing Ansible roles:

- `Benefits:` Helps ensure roles work as expected before being applied in production.
- `Drivers:` Molecule supports multiple providers (like Docker, Vagrant, etc.) so you can test roles in different environments.

## Using Molecule

1. `Installation:` `pip install molecule`.
2. `Initialization:` Start a new role with testing setup via `molecule init role <role_name>`.
3. `Testing:` Run tests using `molecule test`.
